        <p>          <i> She sat knitting on the porch for hours. 
           <br>The lush gardens surrounding her with their aromas of plenty.</i></p>

        <p> honey were his eyes,

       <br>  like warm butter how it slides down her skin
       <br> the colour, so rich, like cherry jam on toddlers faces
       <br> humans; flawed. 
       <br> our species will fade as quick as life leaving the eyes of 
       <br>
       <br> a child 
       <br> a mother 
       <br> a brother 
       <br> a father 
       <br> a sister 
       <br> an uncle 
       <br> an aunt 
       <br> a human.
       <br>
       <br> how many more cherry-faced toddlers have to turn into 
       <br> another name we remember 
       <br> another hashtag we create
